# Node.js-server-response
Node.js server response

// we have to set one of the predefined headers in node.js check Docs /resourses


// we use .setHeader() to set header


// .write() is used to return html 


// we will learn a much better way to return html using TEMPLATING when we learn Express.js


// .end() tells that the response/html has eneded hence we use .write() after the .end() then it will give us a error


// process.exit() is used to exit from the loop after the first request i.e the node.js code will stop executing once the first request is send
